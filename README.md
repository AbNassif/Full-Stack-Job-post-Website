# What this site is about
These site is a semi clone of a Job Post Website inspired by the admirable movement called "Jobs for Lebanon"(https://www.jobsforlebanon.com). Their aim is to help Lebanon's current economical turmoil by connecting people that currently live in lebanon to Jobs abroad whether it's Remote or onsite. Providing better opportunities for the people one job post at a time.

# What I'll be using: 
- HTML
- CSS
- BOOTSTRAP V5(Css Framework)
- Javascript
- Node.JS
- PUPPETEER.JS
- SQL

# what I'll be changing
- **Look And Feel**
  Decided to change the color scheme and the layout a bit and adding some other images to the main components
  
- **Authentication Free--> Email Validation**
  The whole process of applying and posting a job will be made easier by relying on Emails.
  The user will be asked to validate his Email before applying to each job and the same goes to the 
  Employer.
  
  A constraint of 3 maximum jobs can be posted by each Email a day to avoid spamming!
